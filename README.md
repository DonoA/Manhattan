Manhattan Middle School plugin

Development goals and progress:


### Sky Islands:
There will be a building contest held from October 5th to 19th. The top ten islands selected by my self and the other staff will be used on the survival server for pvp. Make sure that your islands are pvp ready :D

### PVP worlds: _(PVP blocked for all but DG)_
There will be no ‘pvp world’ however there will be pvp locations around the map and on sky islands

### Death Games: _(Almost finished)_
Every 24 hours a player will be selected as the Death Games target. Only players entered to be selected may take part in the killing. For the day, target will have access to PVP and the killers will have access to kill them. At the end of the day the target will get a certain prize!

### Building world: _(Completed 9/23/14)_
There is a creative map for players to build on. When they enter or leave worlds their inventories and locations are saves for when they want to return. items cannot be moved between worlds. Moderators and myself will be able to use VoxelSniper in the creative world. If you see one of us on, feel free to ask for some help!

### Minigames: 
These will be designed in the creative world, then can be copied to the survival world.

### Mineconomy: _(Money is stored in Playerdat now)_
There will be trading posts around to world that can also be used as banks. You can store your money (Emeralds) in the bank and trade your virtual monies. You can use your money to purchase resources and enchantments.

### Hunger Games:
Once a month there will be a hunger games tournament held. This will be on a custom map built for the occasion. The winner will receive a non-vanilla reward based on the skill shown and players beaten.

### Hostile zones: _(Started, has class)_
areas around the map that are made for intense warfare and survival. Regen is off in those areas and so is Keep Inventory. These zones also have goodies dotted around for the adventurous player.

### Sky Wars:
Sky wars can be run and reset by moderators. There is no bonus for winning, and the game can be played as many times as you like.

### Bosses:
There will be several other Bosses for the player to fight. They will have a health bar and do large amounts of damage. They can only be found in hostile zones and are very rare. They can, however, be summoned with the use of extremely valuable items.
